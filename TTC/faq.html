        <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <p>Q: Can hunt people? From the past of course.<br>
         A: No comment. However, note that we accept anything for the right price.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Q: Can I bring along my kids?<br>
            A: IDC. Money talks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Q: I'm not much of a hunter myself, is this the right place to go for an adventure in the past aside from that?<br>
           A: Money Talks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Q: How does your machine work?<br>
           A: You don't want that answer. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Q: Can we get trophies from our kills?<br>
           A: For an additional payment? Sure. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Q: How does this whole time travel thing work? Could I permanently affect the future by altering the past or are they mutually exclusive? <br>
            A: IDK
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Q: Where do I select my travel date in the booking menu? I can't find it.<br>
            A: Trips are booked at a later date after registration. However, we can pull a few time-travel loopholes to get you in within moments of form submission.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Q: Can we bring our own weapons/firearms?<br>
            A: Sure. However our on-site armory contains quite literally every weapon to ever exist.<br>
            <small>**additional fees may be added depending on weapons chosen.
