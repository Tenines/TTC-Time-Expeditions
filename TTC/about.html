        <p>Officially founded in the underground tunnels of Boston in the year 1876, we have sacrificed generations of our lives to create the perfect fiction: a machine capable of breaking all establishments of material reality allowing us to transcend the binds of time.</p>
        <p>We now use this technology for no ulterior motive and merely wish to give the gift of knowledge to the world. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shin-Melial is an otherworldly entity who arrived in an unmanned company time machine one day looking for a job. He remains adamant that his claim to his current occupation as an operative is centered around his casting out of "Helios Ten Abarath and Immortal Sun-Singer High Savant Uldrygg Ur Sin Shemenoth son of Uldrygg Ur-Rex Sin Baalaeghstus". <br><br> Our editor would like to note he does not know what this means, if anything. <br><br>
        Amongst "Shin-Melial's" expansive list of attributes clients should be most aware that according to our many, many tests; Melial is completely unkillable making him one of our strongest operators. The general consensus across the relatively decent span of clients who have traveled with Melial describe him as a "demonic hellspawn" and an "average guide". <br>
        Take that as you will.    </p>
